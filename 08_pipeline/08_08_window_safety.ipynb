    "# Window Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook document demonstrates an error that often boggles Quantopian beginners, namely, the [NonWindowSafeInput](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/blob/bba810078c56bf6f2dad9f1e9653f6833ad2fe4e/zipline/errors.py#L517). This error is a bit confusing because there are multiple conditions that triggers this error. \n",
    "\n",
    "NonWindowSafe error shows up in these scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 1: Adding `latest` to longer than 1-day window**\n",
    "\n",
    "Condition: Using any data with `latest` into a Factor that uses >1 `window_length`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix: To fix this, well, remove the `latest` part.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Using moving average factor in another factor that is longer than 1-day window**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are working with historical data, it is possible that prices get adjusted due to stock splits, dividends, etc. Factors that take these into account e.g. any moving average factor cannot be passed into another factor-creation function. Other functions, like return-related functions, can be passed without triggering this error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the condition for this error is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Moving average factor is used as an input in another factor.\n",
    "2. `window_length` is set to `>1`."
